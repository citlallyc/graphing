This includes graphing randomly devised pipeline data as bar graphs to clearly show categorical data of Application Created (as), Phone Screens (ps), Technical Assessment (TA), Team Interview (TI), Offer, and Hired. I want you to clearly see how many men and women were being moved forward through this recruitment process. 

I created another graph "2021 Hire Details" to show growth across the year. I added the counts above each bar at the end to clearly show how many hires.
